### Background: üîç

Deep Neural networks have already surpassed human level performance in tasks such as object recognition and detection. However, deep networks were lagging far behind in tasks like generating artistic artefacts having high perceptual quality until recent times. Creating better quality art using machine learning techniques is imperative for reaching human-like capabilities, as well as opens up a new spectrum of possibilities. And with the advancement of computer hardware as well as the proliferation of deep learning, deep learning is right now being used to create art. For example, an [AI generated art](https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx) won‚Äôt be sold at an auction for a whopping $432,500.

### Bird Eye View of the an example work to start with :

Neural style transfer is one of the most creative application of convolutional neural networks. By taking a content image and a style image, the neural network can recombine the content and the style image to effectively creating an artistic image!
These algorithms are extremely flexible and the virtually infinite possible combinations of content and style resulted in very creative and unique results.

Neural style transfer uses a pretrained convolution neural network. Then to define a loss function which blends two images seamlessly to create visually appealing art, NST defines the following inputs:
* A content image (c) ‚Äî the image we want to transfer a style to
* A style image (s) ‚Äî the image we want to transfer the style from
* An input (generated) image (g) ‚Äî the image that contains the final result (the only trainable variable)


## Tasks: üìùüìã

- Implement different image processing scripts(using opencv)that can used to enhancing pictures,obtaining information and transforming it for desired purposes
- Use deep learning for the same. Eg: Neural Style Transfer,BlackandWhitetoColor
- Reimplement State-of-the-Art(SOTA) Research papers for the this
- **Suggestion**: Use Tranfer Learning
- For the image processing tasks make custom datasets...use tools like CVAT
- Repeat the same for the deep learning tasks
- Convert the work done in Jupyter Notebooks into executable scripts
- Use TensorFlow.JS to build end to end models for showcase
- Build a website for this project
- Extend the work for some of the sripts to make a Flutter app using TensorFlow Lite
- Improve the documentation (ReadME)

## Points to keep in mind while contributing:

- Please don't push anything to the root directory.Always use specific subdirectories inside the [deeppixel](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/DeepPixel/tree/master/deeppixel) directory 
- For each of the tasks(i.e. problems you solve like denoising an image)..Please put in all the files/model weights/haar cascascades you use in the respective sub-directory
- For each sub-directory..have a images folder dedicated to the images
- For each sub-directory..please upate the README.MD files on what you what worked on
- Don't copy code directly from places like pyimagesearch.com etc..Take them as reference,modify and do it..or atleast give the reference
