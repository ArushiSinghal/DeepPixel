# Denoising Images
The aim of this task is to generate a script which produces denoised images, when noise is added to the images provided as input.

## Approach:
The approach used is :
  1. Different noising techniques have been applied to add noise to the input image and the image with gaussian noise is taken under
     consideration.
  2. From the noisy image low frequency and high frequency components are extracted using filtering techniques.
  3. Then the high and low frequency components are combined in order to generate the denoised image.
  4. The input image is used here for adding noise and comparing it with the denoised image.
