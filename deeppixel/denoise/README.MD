# Denoising Images
The aim of this task is to generate a script which produces denoised images, when noisy images are provided as input.

  ## Approach:
  The approach used is :
  1. Input is taken as image with gaussian noise.
  2. From the noisy image low frequency and high frequency components are extracted using filtering techniques.
  3. Then the high and low frequency components are combined in order to generate the denoised image.
